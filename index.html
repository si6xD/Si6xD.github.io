    <s>Well If you know me in real life then you don't need this but if you are here from my bio or something <br>
    Then I am the guy who is really into computers and Cybersecurity. Yes the same guy who have got arrested in grade school <br>
    but somehow got out, now days I'm just just passing time doing gym, making processors reverse engineering and playing CTF's  </s>
